# SETUP
1. Clone the repo
2. add a call to ```backupToGithub``` in server startup


## TODO

1. Convert bash scripts to batch scripts for windows compatibility (Shouldn't be hard just have to find out how to execute the git commands in bat files)
1. Debate on using a 3rd party account to commit? (If we use our own github accts then we will be able to tell who was running the server at that date/time) Or we can search the user's environment to find the username on the PC and include that.
1. Upload Initial Copy of Server Directory
1. Add a call to ```backupToGithub``` in server startup
