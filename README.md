# SETUP
1. Clone the repo
2. add a call to ```backupToGithub``` in server startup


## TODO

- [ ] Convert bash scripts to batch scripts for windows compatibility (Shouldn't be hard just have to find out how to execute the git commands in bat files)
- [ ] Debate on using a 3rd party account to commit? (If we use our own github accts then we will be able to tell who was running the server at that date/time) Or we can search the user's environment to find the username on the PC and include that.
- [ ] Upload Initial Copy of Server Directory
- [ ] Add a call to ```backupToGithub``` in server startup
- [ ] Convert Date Timestamp to EST 12hr time
